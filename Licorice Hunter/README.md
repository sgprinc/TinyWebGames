# Licorice Hunter

In Licorice Hunter, you are a finnball who's scavenging for licorice candy in the snow.
Although you are quite impervious to the cold, you are not inmune! Try to grab as much candy as you can while warming up in the saunas every now and then.

# Controls
You can control the finnball with the keyboard arrows.
