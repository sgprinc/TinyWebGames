# TinyWebGames
 A set of minimalistic **HTML + JS** web games developed as sample content for a game webstore course project at Aalto University, Finland.

# HSL Escape
**HSL Escape** is a simple *endless runner* game in which the character has to attempt staying in the subway wagons for as long as possible, while avoiding the HSL controllers, mocking the somewhat common practice of students to not buy tickets and try riding for free.

The game uses simple mask-maps to define the positions in the map that can be traversed, and a simple implementation of the A* algorithm for the enemies to chase down the player.


# Licorice Hunter
**Licorice Hunter** is a simple *survical/resource-gathering* game in which the hungry player ventures into the cold to gather licorice candy. Although the cold can be withstood for a while, warming up in the saunas that sporadically appear is necessary to avoid freezing to death.

The game uses random-number generators to spawn the different objects of interest.
